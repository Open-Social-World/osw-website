* **Physical Social Norms (PSNs)** include
    * *utility norms*: cooperation, coorindation, and communication, and
    * *non-utility norms*: privacy, safety, and proxemics.
* Understanding and following PSNs is crucial for deploying robots and AI agents in human social world.
* We introduce a large-scale video dataset, based on Ego4D, with 2,000 videos annotated with relavant norms and normative behaviors.
* We propose a benchmark for evaluating frontier models' understanding of physical social norms through videos.
* Our findings indicate **a significant gap** between current models and human understanding of physical social norms.
