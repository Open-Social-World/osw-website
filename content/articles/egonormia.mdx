<EmphasizedSpan>Humans have a long history of expecting AI or Robots to learn social norms.</EmphasizedSpan> Check out the following sci-fi literature <Citation id="asimov1985caves"/><Citation id="john2006android"/><Citation id="chiang2010lifecycle"/><Citation id="chambers2016closed"/>. This is because **norms** are so fundamental to our social world. Human babies surprisingly learn norms very quickly and enforce them in interactions <Citation id="fehr2004social"/><Citation id="chudek2011culture"/>.

<Callout icon="🍃">
    With EgoNormia, we challenge frontier AI models to perform <EmphasizedSpan>*normative reasoning*</EmphasizedSpan> in physical and social contexts. Here is an example.
</Callout>

<TeaserVideo className="w-full md:w-3/4 lg:w-1/2 mx-auto"/>


<Callout icon="📚">
    To create this benchmark, we propose an <u>[efficient pipeline](#benchmark-generation)</u> through <EmphasizedSpan>asking VLMs what-if questions and multi-round human validation</EmphasizedSpan>.
</Callout>

<Callout icon="📹">
    This results in a <EmphasizedSpan>challenging (SoTA 45% vs Humans 92%)</EmphasizedSpan> and large scale dataset with 1,853 ego-centric videos.
</Callout>

<Callout icon="💡">
    We also propose a retrieval-based approach **NormThinker** to enable in-context learning of normative reasoning in VLMs, which is
    useful even for out-of-domain robotics applications.
</Callout>



## Introduction

In the video example, a hiking partner is stuck in the mud; <EmphasizedSpan>a safety-first norm (keeping one's distance) conflicts with the cooperative norm to help out.</EmphasizedSpan> For humans, the right decision seems intuitive. But can Vision-Language Models (VLMs) navigate such dilemmas? Can they understand norms grounded in the physical world and make normative decisions similar to those of humans?

### Research Questions

{/* To comprehensively measure VLM normative reasoning ability, we introduce EgoNormia, a challenging QA benchmark that is physically grounded in 1k egocentric social interaction clips from [<u>Ego4D</u>](https://ego4d-data.org/) <Citation id="grauman2022ego4dworld3000hours"/>. EgoNormia spans 100 distinct settings across a wide range of activities, cultures, and interactions. */}

<br />

Unlike similarly visually-grounded spatiotemporal, predictive, or causal reasoning benchmarks <Citation id="chandrasegaran2024hourvideo1hourvideolanguageunderstanding"/><Citation id="zellers2019recognition"/>,
<EmphasizedSpan>EgoNormia</EmphasizedSpan> evaluates models' ability to reason about what <EmphasizedSpan>should be done</EmphasizedSpan> under social norms. EgoNormia highlights cases where these norm-related objectives conflict—the richest arena for evaluating normative decision-making.

<br />

We will try to answer the following research questions in this blog post:

* <EmphasizedSpan> **RQ1:** Alignment</EmphasizedSpan> Can VLMs make normative decisions that agree with human consensus?

*  <EmphasizedSpan> **RQ2:** Reasoning</EmphasizedSpan> If VLMs do not agree, is this due to failures in perception (e.g., object recognition) or gaps in normative reasoning?

* <EmphasizedSpan> **RQ3:** Improvement</EmphasizedSpan> Can we use EgoNormia to improve the normative reasoning of VLMs?

## Physical Social Norms


<Callout icon="💡">
    **Physical social norms (PSNs)** are <EmphasizedSpan>shared expectations</EmphasizedSpan> that govern how actors behave and interact with others in the real physical world.
</Callout>



To study physical social norms, we operationalize a taxonomy of PSN categories, which stand for the social objectives that inform them. Some norms explicitly serve the function of maximizing utility across multi-agent systems. We call these the <EmphasizedSpan>utility norms</EmphasizedSpan>. Other norms are more particular to human sociality, which can often stand at odds with group utility norms, which are called <EmphasizedSpan>non-utility norms</EmphasizedSpan> This tension between utility and non-utility norms provides a setting for evaluating agent decision-making under conflicting objectives.


{/* * **Physical Social Norms** include
    * *utility norms*: <span style={{ color: "#C65B4E" }}>cooperation</span> <Citation id="sunstein1996social"/>, <span style={{ color: "#EA772F" }}>communication/legibility</span> <Citation id="francis2023principlesguidelinesevaluatingsocial"/>, and <span style={{ color: "#E6A700" }}>coordination/proactivity</span> <Citation id="paternotte2013social"/>.
    * *non-utility norms*: <span style={{ color: "#246D63" }}>safety</span> <Citation id="lasota2017survey"/>, <span style={{ color: "#356ABC" }}>politeness</span> <Citation id="mills2011politeness"/>, <span style={{ color: "#5C4C99" }}>privacy</span> <Citation id="altman1975environment"/>, and <span style={{ color: "#D87CA6" }}>proxemics</span> <Citation id="huang2022proxemics"/>. */}

## Task

We think a good benchmark for normative reasoning should have the following properties: 1. <EmphasizedSpan>verifiability</EmphasizedSpan> we can evaluate the high-level decision-making capabilities verifiably, 2. <EmphasizedSpan>diversity</EmphasizedSpan> across contexts and normative categories, 3. <EmphasizedSpan>high human consensus</EmphasizedSpan> via extensive manual validation requiring annotator agreement, and 4. <EmphasizedSpan>challenging</EmphasizedSpan> for models to not able to rely on spurious correlations or superficial reasoning.

### Multiple-Choice Questions
We use a format of Multiple-Choice Questions (MCQs) for our task to achieve high verifiability, including three subtasks: **Action Selection**, **Justification Selection**, and **Sensibility**.

<ExampleMCQ />

* <EmphasizedSpan>**Subtask 1:** Action Selection</EmphasizedSpan> In this subtask, the model is provided with video frames of an activity and five candidate actions. Given these inputs, the model is asked to select the single most normatively appropriate action to perform in the context

* <EmphasizedSpan>**Subtask 2:** Justification Selection</EmphasizedSpan> In this subtask, the model is provided with the same visual input as in Subtask 1 and is asked to select the best justification supporting its chosen normative action.

* <EmphasizedSpan>**Subtask 3:** Sensibility</EmphasizedSpan> To measure whether models understand the features that make action normative in context, we evaluate whether they can select the sensible (i.e. normative, but not necessarily best) options from the given actions.

* <EmphasizedSpan>**Phase I:** Snippet Sampling</EmphasizedSpan> We sourced video samples from [<u>Ego4D</u>](https://ego4d-data.org/) <Citation id="grauman2022ego4dworld3000hours"/>. To ensure diversity, we applied a multi-step filtering process, sampling each unique scenario-verb combination to select video snippets across a wide range of social and physical contexts.

* <EmphasizedSpan>**Phase II:** Answer Generation</EmphasizedSpan> For each video sample, we generate four pairs of actions and justifications—one ground truth pair and three distractor pairs. To create challenging distractors, we systematically perturb the original context by altering key details that influence the interpretation of the action.

* <EmphasizedSpan>**Phase III:** Filtering</EmphasizedSpan>  We perform normativity filtering by using chained LLMs to filter for answer feasibility and sensibility, then run blind filtering (i.e. no vision input) to remove questions answerable without context or through superficial reasoning.

*  <EmphasizedSpan>**Phase IV:** Human Validation</EmphasizedSpan> Finally, two human validators are employed to verify the correct behavior and justification, and to select the list of actions that are considered sensible. Two validators are used to ensure every datapoint receives independent agreement from two humans, ensuring that human agreement on EgoNormia is replicable. The authors manually process datapoints where validators disagree on answers, ensuring that the benchmark remains challenging and achieves high human agreement.

Through automatic clustering with GPT-4o, we categorize the final videos into 5 high-level and 23 low-level categories, highlighting the rich diversity of our dataset.

## Results

We evaluated the following state-of-the-art foundation models: Gemini 1.5 Flash/Pro <Citation id="team2024gemini"/>, GPT-4o <Citation id="hurst2024gpt"/>, Claude 3.5 Sonnet <Citation id="anthropic2024claude"/>, o3-mini (medium reasoning setting) <Citation id="o3mini"/>, Deepseek R1 <Citation id="guo2025deepseek"/>, InternVL 2.5 <Citation id="chen2024expanding"/>, and Qwen 2.5 VL <Citation id="Qwen2.5-VL"/>. Gemini 1.5 Pro, the best-performing model in our evaluation, achieved a mean accuracy of 45.3%, suggesting that <EmphasizedSpan> current models have limited ability to make embodied normative decisions (RQ1)</EmphasizedSpan>. Check out live [<u>leaderboard</u>](/leaderboard).

### Perception vs. reasoning
To investigate causes for the limited normative reasoning ability of VLMs, We further categorize errors in normative reasoning by annotating the models' full CoT responses on 100 representative tasks of EgoNormia. Four
failure modes were identified: (1) norm sensibility errors, (2) norm prioritization errors, (3) perception errors, and (4) answer refusal. For models, the majority of failures were due to sensibility errors instead of perception, suggesting that <EmphasizedSpan>foundation models are competent in processing the visual context of the video inputs but fail in performing sound normative reasoning on the parsed context</EmphasizedSpan>.

## Learning from human-annotated norms

To answer **can we use EgoNormia to improve the normative reasoning of VLMs? (RQ3)** We propose performing retrieval over the context present in EgoNormia, a strategy we call <EmphasizedSpan>NormThinker</EmphasizedSpan>, to guide VLMs in making contextually-grounded normative decisions.

<br />

We curate an out-of-domain test dataset based on <EmphasizedSpan>egocentric robotic assistant footage</EmphasizedSpan> <Citation id="zhu2024siat"/>, selected as its context and embodiment are orthogonal to those seen in Ego4D. The NormThinker pipeline is shown below:

      marginRight: 'auto',
    }}
  />
</div>

We evaluate NormThinker on 11 these datapoints. Without NormThinker, GPT-4o correctly completed only 1 out of 11 tasks. <EmphasizedSpan> With NormThinker, the accuracy improved significantly to 5 out of 11.</EmphasizedSpan>
We further evaluate on held-out instances in EgoNormia. We demonstrate improvement relative to the best non-RAG model and base GPT-4o on unseen in-domain tasks, <EmphasizedSpan>obtaining an EgoNormia bench 9.4% better than base GPT-4o, and 7.9% better than learning from randomly retrieved data.</EmphasizedSpan>
